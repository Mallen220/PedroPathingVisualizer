## **Features**

### **Robot Profile Manager**

Manage multiple robot configurations for different robots and scenarios.

- **Create, edit, and delete** named profiles (dimensions, max velocity, acceleration, etc.).
- **Quick apply**: switch profiles from the Control tab or from Settings and immediately apply the robot parameters in the workspace.
- **Persisted across sessions**: profiles are stored locally so your setups are available on restart.

### **Paths Tab — Visual Overhaul**

The Paths tab (Control) has been fully redesigned to match other sections of the app and improve clarity.

- **Card-based layout** with clear grouping of segments and sections for faster scanning.
- **Compact, inline inputs** and labels to conserve space and improve readability on smaller screens.
- **Responsive behaviour**: controls collapse and reflow for narrow windows, improving usability on small monitors and tablets.
- **Improved keyboard and focus navigation** so you can edit coordinates and sections without reaching for the mouse.

### **Command Palette — Expanded**

The Command Palette (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) now includes file and settings actions:

- **File actions**: New Project, Open File, Save, and quick Export commands are available directly from the palette.
- **Settings shortcuts**: toggle or jump to common settings entries from the palette.
- **Search + shortcuts**: commands show associated shortcuts (where applicable) and recent commands float to the top.

### **New Shortcuts & Actions**

A set of standard and productivity shortcuts have been added:

- **New Project:** `Ctrl+N` / `Cmd+N`
- **Open File:** `Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O`
- **File Manager:** `Ctrl+Shift+M` / `Cmd+Shift+M`
- **Export:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Export Java), `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Export Points)
- **Focus Inputs:** Press `X`, `Y`, or `H` to quickly focus and edit coordinate fields

## **Improvements**

- **Safer deletions**: delete buttons (waypoints, obstacles, profiles) now require a confirmation click to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Smaller-screen polish**: spacing, paddings, and input sizes adjusted to work better on narrow windows.
- **Accessibility & discoverability**: many command labels, tooltips, and keyboard hints have been added or clarified.

---

## **Developer / CI**

- **GitHub Actions release workflow**: added a cross-platform workflow that builds and uploads release artifacts for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The workflow collects logs and artifacts to make Linux packaging failures (e.g., rpmbuild issues) reproducible and easier to diagnose.
- **Packaging metadata**: small tweaks to packaging configuration to improve reproducibility across platforms.

---

## **Bug Fixes & Notes**

- Fixed layout regressions in the Paths tab that caused controls to overflow on small screens.
- Fixed missing file actions in the Command Palette.
- Fixed several shortcut conflicts and made common actions easier to discover.
- If you experience issues with Linux packaging, please attach the full workflow logs and artifacts to your issue so we can investigate quickly.
