### What's New!

## **Features:**

- **Autosave is Here!**
  - Your work is now saved automatically as you make changes. No more panic over lost progress.
  - Safe file switching ensures your data is secure before moving to another project.

- **Smart Onion Skins**
  - Added a new setting to show onion skins only for the current path segment during animation.
  - This reduces clutter and helps you focus on the immediate motion of the robot.

- **Streamlined Setup**
  - A new setup dialog guides you to select your project directory when you first launch the app.
  - No more automatic folder creation in unexpected places.

## **Improvements:**

  - Updated Linux installation instructions for a smoother start.
