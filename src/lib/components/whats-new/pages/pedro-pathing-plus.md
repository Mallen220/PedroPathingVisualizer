# PedroPathingPlus

**PedroPathingPlus** is an advanced pathing library for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). It is implemented as a plugin that extends the [Pedro Pathing](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/PedroPathing) library and integrates robust, command-based structures. The project is still in its early stages; the goal is to add support for a wide range of features users may need.

> PedroPathingPlus is primarily tested with a SolversLib pinpoint chassis. Errors may occur on other designs; these will be remedied as they are discovered. If you encounter issues, please open a detailed issue (including logs) on the project's GitHub repository.
