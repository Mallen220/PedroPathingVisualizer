## 🚀 Overview

**Pedro Pathing Visualizer** is a powerful desktop application built with Electron and Svelte, designed to revolutionize how FIRST Robotics Competition teams plan their autonomous routines. Unlike web-based alternatives, this tool runs natively on your machine, offering superior performance, local file management, and deep integration with your development workflow.

## 🌟 Unmatched Features

Pedro Pathing Visualizer isn't just a port of the web tool—it's a complete reimagining of what path planning should be. Here's why you should make the switch:

### 🚀 **Next-Level Performance & Workflow**
- **Native Desktop Experience**: Built with Electron for blazing fast performance. Works offline, supports multiple windows, and integrates with your OS.
- **Local File System**: Open and save `.pp` files directly on your computer. No more uploading/downloading or losing work to browser cache clears.
- **Git Integration**: See your file status (Modified, Staged, Untracked) instantly. Version control your paths alongside your robot code.
- **Auto-Save & History**: Never lose progress with robust Auto-Save and full Undo/Redo support.

### 📊 **Professional Analysis & Simulation**
- **Telemetry Overlay**: Import real robot log data to see exactly how your path performed on the field compared to the plan.
- **Advanced Statistics**: View Velocity Graphs, Acceleration profiles, and Timing breakdowns.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize robot velocity along the path with color-coded gradients to spot bottlenecks.
- **Physics-Based Simulation**: Real-time kinematics simulation with accurate velocity constraints and acceleration profiles.

### 🛠️ **Powerful Planning Tools**
- **File Macros**: Reuse successful path sequences! Drag and drop other `.pp` files to use them as sub-routines (macros) with support for transformations (mirror/reverse).
- **Smart Validators**:
  - **Collision Detection**: Real-time feedback on Obstacles and Keep-In Zones.
  - **Continuous Validation**: Option to check your path's safety in real-time as you edit.
  - **Diff View**: Visually compare your current changes against the saved version.
  - **Onion Skinning**: See previous path states to make precise adjustments.
- **Path Optimizer**: Single-click optimization to refine your paths for maximum speed while respecting field boundaries and obstacles.
- **Custom Field Maps**: Import any field image with the built-in Calibration Wizard.

### ⚡ **Efficiency Boosters**
- **Interactive Onboarding**: New to the app? The built-in interactive tutorial will guide you through your first path.
- **Robot Profile Manager**: Manage multiple robot configurations with unique dimensions and constraints, and switch between them instantly.
- **Command Palette**: Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to instantly search for paths, settings, or commands.
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with community plugins or build your own to add custom tabs and tools.
- **Presentation Mode**: One-click cleaner interface for demonstrating paths to judges or teammates.
- **Export Power**:
  - **Java Code**: Generates `PedroPathingPlus` compliant code.
  - **Visuals**: Export high-quality **APNG** and **GIF** animations of your paths.

### ✨ **Stunning UI & UX Overhaul**
We've polished every pixel to make path planning a joy.
- **Modern Clean Interface**: A complete visual refresh with standardized color-coding (Green for Paths, Amber for Waits, Pink for Rotates) makes complex routines easy to read at a glance.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you're on a laptop or a massive monitor, the UI scales perfectly. Mobile-friendly resizing means it even works on smaller screens if you need to check a path on the go.
- **Intuitive Dialogs**: Redesigned settings and file managers that are easier to navigate and nicer to look at.

### ⚙️ **Under-the-Hood Engineering**
It's not just about looks—the engine is brand new.
- **Performance**: Major backend refactoring and optimized field rendering logic mean the app runs smoother, even with complex paths and heavy telemetry data.
- **Readability**: The codebase has been cleaned up and modernized, making it easier for contributors to add features (and for the app to run without hiccups).
- **Stability**: Automated testing and continuous validation ensure that the app is reliable when you need it most—at the competition.

### 🎨 **Fully Customizable**
- **Theming**: Light Mode, Dark Mode, and custom theme plugins.
- **Keybindings**: Every action is remappable. Custom profiles supported.
- **Font Sizing**: Adjustable font sizes to suit your preference and screen resolution.

Oh, and so so many little improvements not even included yet! Check back often for a growing list of upgrades!

## 📥 Installation

### **macOS**

**One-Line Installer (Recommended):**
Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/main/install.sh | bash
```

_Enter your password when prompted to complete installation._

**Manual Installation:**

1.  Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).
2.  Mount the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder.
3.  **Important**: Run the following command in Terminal to clear the quarantine attribute (prevents "App is damaged" errors):
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app"
    ```
4.  Launch the application.

### **Windows**

1.  Download the latest `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).
2.  Run the installer.
3.  _Note: If SmartScreen appears, click "More info" > "Run anyway"._

### **Linux**

**One-Line Installer (Recommended):**
Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/main/install.sh | bash
```

_Enter your password when prompted to complete installation._

**Manual Installation:**

1.  Download the `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).
2.  Fix permissions for Sandboxing by installing and adding "--no-sandboxing" to the .desktop icons.

## 🗂️ File Management

One of the critical advantages of Pedro Pathing Visualizer over web-based tools is its **Local File Management system**.

- **Security & Persistence**: Your paths are saved as actual files (`.pp`) on your hard drive, not in a temporary browser cache that can be accidentally cleared.
- **Version Control**: You can easily commit your path files to Git alongside your robot code, ensuring your team always has the latest versions.
- **Organization**: Use the built-in file browser to organize paths into folders, duplicate successful routines, and manage backups without leaving the app.

## 🛠️ Tool Overview

### **Canvas Tools**

- **Grid & Snap**: Toggle customizable grids (1" - 24") and enable snapping for perfect alignment.
- **Ruler**: Measure distances instantly between any two points on the field.
- **Protractor**: Measure relative angles, with options to lock to the robot's heading.

### **Path Editing**

- **Control Points**: Fine-tune Bezier curves by manipulating control handles.
- **Heading Modes**: Choose between Tangential, Constant, or Linear heading interpolation for precise robot orientation.
- **Event Markers**: Place named triggers along the path to fire actions (e.g., "Open Claw") at exact path percentages.

### **Animation Controller**

- **Timeline**: Scrub through your autonomous routine to verify timing and sequence order.
- **Real-time Feedback**: See exact robot coordinates and heading at any point in time.

## 📤 Export Options

The visualizer provides flexible export capabilities to suit your team's workflow:

1.  **Java Class**: Generates a complete, ready-to-run Java file for your FTC robot controller.
2.  **Sequential Commands**: Exports code formatted for command-based frameworks, integrating paths with your subsystems.
3.  **JSON / Text**: Raw data export for custom parsers or debugging.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **macOS**

- **"App is damaged" / Can't Open**:
  Run the quarantine fix command:
  ```bash
  sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app"
  ```
- **Gatekeeper**: If the app is blocked, go to _System Settings > Privacy & Security_ and click "Open Anyway".

### **Windows**

- **SmartScreen Warning**: This is common for new software. Click "More Info" and "Run Anyway".
- **Antivirus**: If the file is flagged, adds an exception. The code is open source and safe.

### **Linux**

- **AppImage not running**: Ensure you have `libfuse2` installed and have given the file execution permissions (`chmod +x`).
