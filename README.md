## 🚀 Overview

**Pedro Pathing Visualizer** is a powerful desktop application built with Electron and Svelte, designed to revolutionize how FIRST Robotics Competition teams plan their autonomous routines. Unlike web-based alternatives, this tool runs natively on your machine, offering superior performance, local file management, and deep integration with your development workflow.

## ✨ Features

Experience a comprehensive suite of tools designed for precision and efficiency:

*   **🎨 Visual Path Editing**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating complex Bezier curves, straight lines, and path chains.
*   **🤖 Advanced Simulation**: Real-time robot physics simulation featuring accurate kinematics, velocity constraints, and acceleration profiles.
*   **⚠️ Obstacle & Collision Detection**: Define custom field obstacles (polygons) and get immediate feedback on potential collisions during path planning.
*   **🔄 Sequence Editor**: Build full autonomous routines by sequencing paths, adding wait times, and triggering event markers.
*   **💾 Local File Management**: Robust system for saving, loading, and organizing `.pp` project files directly on your file system.
*   **📤 Powerful Export Options**:
    *   **Java Code**: Generate full OpModes for the Pedro Pathing library.
    *   **APNG & GIF Export**: Share your path animations with the team using high-quality exported visualizer recordings.
    *   **JSON Export**: Raw data export for custom parsers.
*   **⚡ Productivity Tools**:
    *   **Onion Skinning**: Visualize previous path states for precise adjustments.
    *   **Undo/Redo**: Full history support for mistake-free editing.
    *   **Multi-Window Support**: Open multiple project windows simultaneously.
*   **📏 Precision Tools**: Integrated Ruler, Protractor, and customizable Grid snapping (1" - 24") for exact field positioning.
*   **🛠️ Customization**: Full support for custom field maps, robot sizing, color themes, and adjustable safe margins.
*   **📦 Cross-Platform**: Native, optimized applications for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
*   **♾️ And so, so much more!** Check back often for updates and new features. 

## 📥 Installation

### **macOS**

**One-Line Installer (Recommended):**
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/main/install.sh | bash
```
*Enter your password when prompted to complete installation.*

**Manual Installation:**
1.  Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).
2.  Mount the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder.
3.  **Important**: Run the following command in Terminal to clear the quarantine attribute (prevents "App is damaged" errors):
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app"
    ```
4.  Launch the application.

### **Windows**
1.  Download the latest `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).
2.  Run the installer.
3.  *Note: If SmartScreen appears, click "More info" > "Run anyway".*

### **Linux**
Download the `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `.AppImage` from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases).

**AppImage:**
```bash
chmod +x Pedro*.AppImage
./Pedro*.AppImage
```

## 🗂️ File Management

One of the critical advantages of Pedro Pathing Visualizer over web-based tools is its **Local File Management system**.

*   **Security & Persistence**: Your paths are saved as actual files (`.pp`) on your hard drive, not in a temporary browser cache that can be accidentally cleared.
*   **Version Control**: You can easily commit your path files to Git alongside your robot code, ensuring your team always has the latest versions.
*   **Organization**: Use the built-in file browser to organize paths into folders, duplicate successful routines, and manage backups without leaving the app.

## 🛠️ Tool Overview

### **Canvas Tools**
*   **Grid & Snap**: Toggle customizable grids (1" - 24") and enable snapping for perfect alignment.
*   **Ruler**: Measure distances instantly between any two points on the field.
*   **Protractor**: Measure relative angles, with options to lock to the robot's heading.

### **Path Editing**
*   **Control Points**: Fine-tune Bezier curves by manipulating control handles.
*   **Heading Modes**: Choose between Tangential, Constant, or Linear heading interpolation for precise robot orientation.
*   **Event Markers**: Place named triggers along the path to fire actions (e.g., "Open Claw") at exact path percentages.

### **Animation Controller**
*   **Timeline**: Scrub through your autonomous routine to verify timing and sequence order.
*   **Real-time Feedback**: See exact robot coordinates and heading at any point in time.

## 📤 Export Options

The visualizer provides flexible export capabilities to suit your team's workflow:

1.  **Java Class**: Generates a complete, ready-to-run Java file for your FTC robot controller.
2.  **Sequential Commands**: Exports code formatted for command-based frameworks, integrating paths with your subsystems.
3.  **JSON / Text**: Raw data export for custom parsers or debugging.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **macOS**
*   **"App is damaged" / Can't Open**:
    Run the quarantine fix command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app"
    ```
*   **Gatekeeper**: If the app is blocked, go to *System Settings > Privacy & Security* and click "Open Anyway".

### **Windows**
*   **SmartScreen Warning**: This is common for new software. Click "More Info" and "Run Anyway".
*   **Antivirus**: If the file is flagged, adds an exception. The code is open source and safe.

### **Linux**
*   **AppImage not running**: Ensure you have `libfuse2` installed and have given the file execution permissions (`chmod +x`).
