## 2026-01-15 - Inline Actions over Native Dialogs

Learning: Native `confirm()` dialogs are disruptive and cannot be styled. Users prefer inline confirmation (like "Click again to confirm") for destructive or major actions within a settings context.
Action: Use `DeleteButtonWithConfirm` or similar inline confirmation patterns for actions like "Delete" or "Update" to maintain flow and visual consistency.
