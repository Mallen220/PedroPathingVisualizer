## 2024-05-23 - [Math Optimization] **Learning:** Recursive algorithms for geometric calculations (like De Casteljau) can cause significant GC pressure in high-frequency loops (e.g., rendering or sampling curves). **Action:** Prefer iterative implementations with reused object buffers for core math utilities.
## 2026-01-14 - [Geometry Optimization] **Learning:** Passing arrays (e.g., `[x, y]`) to frequently called geometry functions creates significant GC pressure in hot loops (like collision detection). **Action:** Refactor geometry utils to accept primitive `x, y` arguments instead of point arrays or objects.
